#### This is an experiment in which I build custom APIs for the first time.

**Features:**

- A profile API with functionality to list all profiles, retrieve a single profile by id, and edit a profile with a particular id.

- A posts API with functionality to create a post, list all posts, retrieve a single post by id, edit a post with a particular id, and delete a post by id.

**Technologies used:** 

- django-3.2.20 
- django Rest Framework
- cloudinary-1.33.0 
- Pillow-8.2.0
